The following tools and programming language were used for my project.

1.I chose R (3.0.1) because it is commonly used in bioinformatic. R is a readily available free software 
programming language that is used for statistical computing and graphics.R 
has many algorithm packages to choose from along with alot of helpful resources on the web.

--To get started, I first had to install the required packages (biocLite) into R using source(). 
--Then load the library(affy, affydata).
--Go to a database website, in my case GEO, in order to download the .CEL file.
--After I extracted the zip files into my directory, the R coding was implemented.

Platform compatibility

-Windows (64 or 32 bits)
-Mac OS
-Linux/Unix

2. ARACNe was the unsupervised gene regulatory inference tool that I used to identify transcriptional interactions between gene products using microarray gene expression profile data. 
--To get the algorithm software, I had to install to geWorkbench that’s compatible with my platform
--Register to get it downloaded
--Go to toolsà component configuration
--Click on the ARACNe box, then run the data for analysis
